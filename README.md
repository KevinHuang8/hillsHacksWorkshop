### Introduction

##### Installation

Go to this URL: https://www.python.org/downloads/, and click on "Download Python 3.6.4" Make sure it's Python 3 and not Python 2. Even if people already have Python, tell them to do it anyway to make sure everyone is using the same version.

Open the downloaded file, and then click next at every step.

The program people should open is called "IDLE," which should've been automatically downloaded

Type these two lines into IDLE. No explanation is needed yet, tell everyone this is just part of the setup in order to begin.
```python
from turtle import *
t = Turtle()
```

This should open up a window.

### Turtle Basics

- `forward()`, `back()`
- `reset()`
- `left()`,`right()`
